# aboutMe
A Website about me. 

I just wanted to create a aimple page to show off my works and skills using a clound based infrastucture. 

For this I am using a simple website with .html extension and I will be using AWS services to host this site. 

To save time, I am using a template called CEEVEE and I have committed the stock files using a message "Initial stock files"
